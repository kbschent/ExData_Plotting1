For this project, I used tidyverse package (1) to use dplyr and accompanying packages some of which were covered in the third course of the Data science specialization (Getting and Cleaning Data).
The tidyverse packages are discussed throughly in "R for Data Science" (2). The code was styled after the tidyverse style guide (3), which is derived from Google's R style guide (4).
